This repository contains the code and supporting materials for my CSE 507 self-introduction assignment. It demonstrates a simple image processing pipeline implemented in Python using PyTorch. The pipeline takes an original photograph, resizes and optionally flips it, sharpens edges using an unsharp mask, converts to grayscale, detects edges with the Sobel operator, thresholds the gradient magnitude to produce a binary edge map, and saves the processed image.

The repository includes:

Python script/notebook with all functions (Gaussian blur, unsharp mask, Sobel edge detection, thresholding, and optional dilation).

Example input and processed output images.

A LaTeX document for the assignment write-up.

The purpose is to illustrate how basic classical image processing operations work step-by-step and to serve as a foundation for future work in biomedical imaging and deep learning.
